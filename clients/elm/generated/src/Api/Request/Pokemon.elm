   PokéAPI
   All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.  ## What is this?  This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.  We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.  ## Where do I start?  We have awesome [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.  This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.  Created by [**Paul Hallett**(]https://github.com/phalt) and other [**PokéAPI contributors***](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi#contributing) around the world. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.
