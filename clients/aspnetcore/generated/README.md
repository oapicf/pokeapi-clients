# Org.OpenAPITools - ASP.NET Core 8.0 Server

All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.

## What is this?

This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.

## Where do I start?

We have awesome [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.

Created by [**Paul Hallett**(]https://github.com/phalt) and other [**PokéAPI contributors***](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi#contributing) around the world. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.
