# 

All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.

## What is this?

This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.

## Where do I start?

We have awesome [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.

## Getting Started


```groovy

def limit = 56 // Integer | Number of results to return per page.
def offset = 56 // Integer | The initial index from which to return the results.
def q = "q_example" // String | > Only available locally and not at [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) Case-insensitive query applied on the `name` property. 

apiInstance.berryFirmnessList(limit, offset, q)
    {
    // on success
    def result = (PaginatedBerryFirmnessSummaryList)it
    println result
    
}
    {
    // on failure
    statusCode, message ->
        println "${statusCode} ${message}"
};
