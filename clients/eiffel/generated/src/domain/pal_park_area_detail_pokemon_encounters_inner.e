 		All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.  ## What is this?  This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.  We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.  ## Where do I start?

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.
