# Go API Server for openapi

All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.

## What is this?

This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.

## Where do I start?

We have awesome [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.

Created by [**Paul Hallett**(]https://github.com/phalt) and other [**PokéAPI contributors***](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi#contributing) around the world. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.

### Running the server

```

docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it openapi
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
